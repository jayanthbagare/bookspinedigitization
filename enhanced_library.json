Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future.

It's a new feeling, new and shiny. I want so much from her: her trust, her obedience, her submission. I want her to be mine, but right now . . . I'm hers.\" Christian Grey exercises control in all things; his world is neat, disciplined, and utterly empty—until the day that Anastasia Steele falls into his office, in a tangle of shapely limbs and tumbling brown hair. He tries to forget her, but instead is swept up in a storm of emotion he cannot comprehend and cannot resist. Unlike any woman he has known before, shy, unworldly Ana seems to see right through him—past the business prodigy and the penthouse lifestyle to Christian's cold, wounded heart. Will being with Ana dispel the horrors of his childhood that haunt Christian every night? Or will his dark sexual desires, his compulsion to control, and the self-loathing that fills his soul drive this girl away and destroy the fragile hope she offers him?

In this book, based on the metaphor “Love/Text is Energy,” love in fiction is interpreted in the same way as subatomic particles are studied in quantum mechanics — by investigating traces of their clashes in giant colliders, i.e., as Marx’s ‘converted forms’ of the protagonists’ conscious and unconscious decisions and actions. The book introduces the Token Valence Method, which assumes that a word, like an elementary particle, is neither a particle nor a wave but rather a quantum state. The TVM has revealed three models of love patterns in fiction: adaptation (21st century), alienation (20th century), and imagination (1991-2021).",

But before leaving his much-loved Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around old Blighty, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had for so long been his home. The resulting book, Notes from a Small Island, is a eulogy to the country that produced Marmite, George Formby, by-elections, milky tea, place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowells, Gardeners' Question Time and people who say, 'Mustn't grumble.' Britain will never seem the same again. Once ensconced back home in New Hampshire, Bryson couldn't resist the invitation to write a weekly dispatch for the Mail on Sunday's Night & Day magazine. Notes from a Big Country is a collection of eighteen months' worth of his popular columns about that strangest of phenomena - the American way of life. Whether discussing the dazzling efficiency of the garbage disposal unit, the exoticism of having your groceries bagged for you, or the mind-numbing frequency of commercial breaks on American TV, Bill Bryson brings his inimitable brand of bemused wi",

Doctor Nora Kelly must outwit a powerful corporate adversary to diagnose her patient’s illness and safeguard her community. An anonymous blue patient arrives at the doorstep of Oakland City Hospital and cries out for her young daughter before passing out. Doctor Nora Kelly must struggle against the clock to diagnose her patient’s life-threatening illness and alarming discoloration. Her task becomes more difficult when the patient awakens but refuses to speak with anyone on staff, fearing reprisals from immigration and child-protection authorities. Nora suspects that her patient’s illness is caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, and she worries that others in the woman's encampment may be endangered as well. But the patient remains silent. Only after she learns that Nora saved her life does she agree to answer Nora’s questions—for a price. In return, Nora must locate the woman's daughter and deliver a confidential message. Nora’s end of the bargain marks the beginning of a perilous journey that leads her to an encampment at a decrepit local stadium site. With the help of her colleagues, she desperately searches for the daughter as she also discovers that other encampment residents have succumbed to toxic exposures. Her insistent attempts to prove the site’s environmental contamination come up against powerful systemic forces and trigger dangerous personal consequences.",

McLaverty-Robinson's careful reading renders Bhabha's theories in plain English, without losing their meaning. In addition, McLaverty-Robinson's incisive critique cuts through the theoretical aura of Bhabha's work and explores whether his theories work in practice - either empirically or politically. This third and final volume explores the political content and implications of Bhabha's work. It explores Bhabha's political proposals, such as the ideas of a community of suffering and a right to narrate. It also explores Bhabha's relationship to neoliberalism and to the Eurocommunist current in the 1980s, and his critical engagements with liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism, critical race theory, Deleuze and Guattari, and Frantz Fanon. This volume also includes an entire chapter providing a background on neoliberalism, and a comprehensive index covering all three volumes.",

Hofmann’s work and Hofmann himself became the “spiritual” as well as the scientific leader of the testing of psychedelics. Neuroscience, psychiatry, pharmacology, and consciousness studies as well as the arts all listened to Hofmann, and explored the impact on the understanding of the consciousness and treating mental disorders. The symposium on psychedelics in 2006 opened a resurgence of research projects with the intent of studying the effects of psychedelics on humans. It was hoped that the long hiatus on psychedelic research was coming to an end. Just five weeks later in 2006 there was a Supreme Court decision by then new Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who ruled that religious sects could import the drink Ayahuasca to the United States. Ayahuasca contained a schedule 1 substance called DMT, but the ruling was based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. This act was specifically developed for Native Americans and their use of peyote in their ceremonies. The Court’s actions opened a religious path to the legal recognition of psychedelic drugs.

There are plenty of different experiences out there that can and should be explored, and psychedelics could be the way that these experiences are best explored. Michael Pollan looks at different research that has been done throughout a range of different fields, including depression, addiction and \"healthy normal\" and seeks to find a way that psychedelics could be the answer to the question of how to change our world and improve our sense of \"normal.\" The researchers are discussed here with reference to some of the patients who have participated in their experiments and been helped in different ways. These patients feel they have been cured, and some of them recognize that they have only improved moderately, but still, all seem to see a difference. There are skeptics and more and even several firsthand accounts of Pollan's experiences and the ones that he has garnered from others. No matter what may be happening in the world at large, there may be a future for psychedelics in changing that future and improving the mental health of all of those around us at the same time. By exploring each of these types of research Pollan hopes to understand whether psychedelics should be evaluated further and whether the current laws restricting them as Schedule 1 narcotics from the FDA are something that should be reevaluated as well. He seeks, through the course of this book, to evaluate the important nature of psychedelics and all of the things that they have been able to do throughout history as well as throughout different stages of the recent past and even what may happen in the future. Through this process, it's possible to think about the ways that psychedelics and the experiences that occur as a result of them may just be the answer that modern medicine is looking for or could at least hold the key to something different about our consciousness.

A dominant man always keeps his posture. It gives off confidence and virility. The most dominant men were historically those who were able to score the best habitat, hunting grounds, and women. 2) The man who dominates and stays on top for the longest time is the one who knows how to forge good relations with those beneath him.

At the example of various immigrants which are subject to the novel I try to point out the problems these people have when coming to a foreign country. Different types of immigrants are described with their own peculiar characteristics and their way of coping with the new situation. Finally it shall become clear that there are at least three types of immigrants which differ completely from each other in their way of coping with their situation in a “foreign“ country. Furthermore the question shall be answered, whether complete assimilation to a foreign culture is possible or not. In the first chapter the two protagonists of the Satanic Verses, Saladin Chamcha and Gibreel Farishta are introduced, illustrating how much both characters are subject to the aspect of translation. Then, in the following chapters I am going to introduce three types of immigrants which are characteristic of people coming to a foreign country, critically judging the way in which they try to cope with their personal situation. For this purpose the Indianborn people Saladin Chamcha, John Maslama, Hind Sufyan, the Imam and Mishal and Anahita Sufyan are introduced. The paper concludes in chapter 7 with a summary of the most important points of discussion. In addition it should be mentioned that this homework is different from the usual literary-based papers of students studying English literature. Here, the emphasis is put on a close reading of the Satanic Verses instead of a deeper analysis of secondary literature. Thus, I only refer to one source of information in the list of works cited which helped me to understand various aspects of Indian religion und society. [...]",

Now the debate is different: to what extent should our lives be directed and controlled by powerful digital systems - and on what terms? Digital technologies - from artificial intelligence to blockchain, from robotics to virtual reality - are transforming the way we live together. Those who control the most powerful technologies are increasingly able to control the rest of us.

Mayne then explores political paradigms and ideologies through a main political spectrum to various alternatives. He outlines some possible elements for a new political paradigm that would be holistic in several different ways. Finally, he outlines scenarios for three possible futures and presents conclusions that indicate what can be done to achieve a political transiton to maximize the prospects for a good human future in the 21st century.",

          "description": "From the end of Georgia's white primary in 1946 to the present, Atlanta has been a community of growing black electoral strength and stable white economic power. Yet the ballot box and investment money never became opposing weapons in a battle for domination. Instead, Atlanta experienced the emergence and evolution of a biracial coalition. Although beset by changing conditions and significant cost pressures, this coalition has remained intact. At critical junctures forces of cooperation overcame antagonisms of race and ideology. While retaining a critical distance from rational choice theory, author Clarence Stone finds the problem of collective action to be centrally important. The urban condition in America is one of weak and diffuse authority, and this situation favors any group that can act cohesively and control a substantial body of resources. Those endowed with a capacity to promote cooperation can attract allies and overcome oppositional forces. On the negative side of the political ledger, Atlanta's style of civic cooperation is achieved at a cost. Despite an ambitious program of physical redevelopment, the city is second only to Newark, New Jersey, in the poverty rate. Social problems, conflict of interest issues, and inattention to the production potential of a large lower class bespeak a regime unable to address a wide range of human needs. No simple matter of elite domination, it is a matter of governing arrangements built out of selective incentives and inside deal-making; such arrangements can serve only limited purposes. The capacity of urban regimes to bring about elaborate forms of physical redevelopment should not blind us to their incapacity to address deeply rooted social problems. Stone takes the historical approach seriously. The flow of events enables us to see how some groups deploy their resource advantages to fashion governing arrangements to their liking. But no one enjoys a completely free hand; some arrangements are more workable than others. Stone's theory-minded analysis of key events enables us to ask why and what else might be done. Regime Politics offers readers a political history of postwar Atlanta and an elegant, innovative, and incisive conceptual framework destined to influence the way urban politics is studied.",

          "description": "In today’s complex and interconnected world, scholars of international relations seek to better understand challenges spurred by intensified global communication and interaction. The complex connectedness of modern society and politics compels us to investigate the pattern of interconnections among actors who inhabit social and political spaces. Gabriella Paár-Jákli's study aims to advance theory and practice by examining the networks used by specialists in North America and Europe to achieve their policy goals in the area of science and technology. Her book suggests that to overcome policy problems transnationally, three critical factors should be considered. First, as science and technology policy becomes increasingly critical to resolving global issues, it should be regarded as an integral element of the foreign policy process. Second, as liberal international relations theory argues, the increasing role of NGOs must be taken seriously alongside states as vital agents of policy reform. Third, as transatlantic relations remain center to maintaining the global order, they must be reconsidered. Paar-Jakli assesses the role of digital networks as facilitators of regional cooperation. Utilizing various techniques of social network analysis, her research indicates an active and structurally discernible network in cyberspace among transatlantic organizations, and demonstrates the role of virtual networks as facilitators of cooperative arrangements in transatlantic relations. Paár-Jákli's original research uses social network analysis to investigate transatlantic cooperation, a new approach that will be noteworthy to network and transatlantic scholars as well as policymakers.",

By reading this summary, you will discover the world of computer code, its good and bad sides. You will also discover : that in the 1950s and 1960s, most programmers were women; that the stereotype of the introverted and asocial geek coder is now challenged by the massification of the profession; that the libertarian ideology is widespread among computer programmers; that artificial intelligence is both a progress and a threat, which must be controlled. You use software and applications every day, but you probably don't know how they are made. Behind your screens, there are thousands of lines of code that allow the machine (your computer, your phone, and even your car) to interact with you and do what you tell it to do. These lines of code are written by men and women. Who are they?

          "description": "Door deze samenvatting te lezen, ontdek je de wereld van computercode en de goede en slechte kanten ervan. Je zult ook ontdekken : dat in de jaren 1950 en 1960 de meeste programmeurs vrouwen waren; dat het stereotype van de introverte en asociale geek nu wordt uitgedaagd door de massificatie van het beroep; dat de libertaire ideologie wijdverbreid is onder computerprogrammeurs; dat kunstmatige intelligentie zowel een vooruitgang als een bedreiging is, die onder controle moet worden gehouden. Je gebruikt elke dag software en applicaties, maar je weet waarschijnlijk niet hoe ze worden gemaakt. Achter je schermen zitten duizenden regels code die ervoor zorgen dat de machine (je computer, je telefoon en zelfs je auto) met je kan communiceren en kan doen wat jij hem opdraagt. Deze regels code zijn geschreven door mannen en vrouwen. Wie zijn dat? Ga verder dan de clichés en betreed het geheime universum van degenen die de wereld van morgen maken!",

A versatile performer with a strong grounding in theatre, he surprises audiences with every role he plays-from Officer Khan in Kahaani, Faizal Khan in Gangs of Wasseypur and Shaikh in The Lunchbox to Liak in Badlapur, Chand Nawab in Bajrangi Bhaijan and Dasrath Manjhi in Manjhi. However, the journey to fame and fortune was far from easy-over the years, Nawazuddin Siddiqui went from being a manager at a petrochemical factory in Haridwar to a watchman in Delhi.

At best, it can only be a penultimate one; nor can it be given a rounded-off conclusion, as is possible in a work of fiction.\" So begins the last chapter of My Days, the only memoir from R. K. Narayan, hailed as \"India's most notable novelist and short-story writer\" by the New York Times Book Review. In his usual winning, humorous style, R. K. Narayan shares his life story, beginning in his grandmother's garden in Madras with his ferocious pet peacock. As a young boy with no interest in school, he trains grasshoppers, scouts, and generally takes part in life's excitements. Against the advice of all, especially his commanding headmaster father, the dreaming Narayan takes to writing fiction, and one of his pieces is accepted by Punch magazine (his \"first prestige publication\"). Soon his life includes bumbling British diplomats, curious movie moguls, evasive Indian officials, eccentric journalists, and \"the blind urge\" to fall in love. R. K. Narayan's larger-than-life perception of the human comedy is at once acute and forgiving, and always true to it.",

In India, we have a whole variety of flora that feature in our myths, our epics, our rituals, our worship and our daily life. There is the pipal, under which the Buddha meditated on the path to enlightenment; the banyan, in whose branches hide spirits; the ashoka, in a grove of which Sita sheltered when she was Ravana’s prisoner; the tulsi, without which no Hindu house is considered complete; the bilva, with whose leaves it is possible to inadvertently worship Shiva. Before temples were constructed, trees were open-air shrines sheltering the deity, and many were symbolic of the Buddha himself. Sacred Plants of India systematically lays out the sociocultural roots of the various plants found in the Indian subcontinent, while also asserting their ecological importance to our survival. Informative, thought-provoking and meticulously researched, this book draws on mythology and botany and the ancient religious traditions of India to assemble a detailed and fascinating account of India’s flora.",

How can you accept the failings of the past, the sense of futility in the tasks that consume the present, and the prospect of death that blights the future? In this self-help book with a difference, Kieran Setiya confronts the inevitable challenges of adulthood and middle age, showing how philosophy can help you thrive. You will learn why missing out might be a good thing, how options are overrated, and when you should be glad you made a mistake. You will be introduced to philosophical consolations for mortality. And you will learn what it would mean to live in the present, how it could solve your midlife crisis, and why meditation helps. Ranging from Aristotle, Schopenhauer, and John Stuart Mill to Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as drawing on Setiya’s own experience, Midlife combines imaginative ideas, surprising insights, and practical advice.
